# Running Shell Scripts in Bash
## Making Scripts Executable
To run a shell script, you first need to make it executable. This is done using the `chmod` command:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
This command modifies the permissions of the file script.sh, making it executables.

## Running the Script
Once the script is executable, you can run it using:
```bash
./script.sh
```
